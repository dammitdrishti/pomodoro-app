# Pomodoro Timer

A clean, web-based productivity timer built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project implements the Pomodoro Technique (25-minute work intervals) to help manage time and focus.

## Built With

* **HTML5:** Semantic structure and resource hints.
* **CSS3:** Custom animations, gradient backgrounds, and flexbox layout.
* **JavaScript (ES6):** DOM manipulation and timer logic.

##  Features

* **Visual Timer:** A dynamic circular progress bar that creates a visual representation of time passing.
* **Countdown Logic:** Standard 25-minute focus intervals.
* **Responsive Design:** Looks good on desktop and centered layouts.
* **Start/Reset Control:** Interactive button to manage the timer state.

##  What I Learned

This project was built to strengthen my understanding of core web development concepts, including:

* **CSS Positioning:** Mastering `position: relative` and `position: absolute` to create the layered circular layout.
* **CSS Transforms:** Using `transform: rotate()` and `transform-origin` to animate the progress ring.
* **HTML Structure:** Understanding the difference between block (`div`) and inline (`span`) elements for styling text.
* **Resource Hints:** Using `<link rel="preconnect">` to optimize font loading performance.
* **JavaScript Logic:** Using `setInterval` for the countdown and DOM manipulation to update the HTML in real-time.
